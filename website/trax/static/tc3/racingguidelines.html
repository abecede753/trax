<h2>Staying until the end</h2>
<p>When you join a race in TEPCOTT, you are expected to participate for the full length of it. This means you do not quit before the end or stop by the side of the road, even if you are in last place. Continued reports of rage quitting races or stopping and waiting for them to finish, will result in a warning and potential bans, as will not following any of the guidelines below.</p>


<h2>During a race</h2>

<h4>1) Race cleanly</h4>
<p>1.1) We race with contact turned on because it requires an extra level of skill in overtaking and defending from opponents. This does <em>not</em> however mean contact is allowed. Some side by side rubbing going into a corner when a move is already mostly done cleanly is fine, but knocking someone off-line or causing them to crash most certainly isn't. If this happens as an accident you are expected to <em>pull over</em> to the side of the road <em>away from other cars</em> and wait for the person you hit to get back into position as an apology.</p>

<p>1.2) Driving backwards on the track and intentionally ramming people off the road are severe no-nos and will result in being kicked from TEPCOTT very quickly. If you want to troll please go elsewhere.</p>

<p>1.3) Adding to point 1, When "waiting" for another driver, using a pit is not an appropriate way to give a player the position back, as you still are in front of them overall and everyone has to take said mandatory pit stop anyway.</p>

<p>1.4) If another driver causes an incident where you need them to wait for you, you must explicitly use the phrase "<em>wait</em>" in your voice or text chat informing them clearly that they caused the incident and are required to slow down for you as per rule 1.1.</p>

<p>1.5) When calling a 'wait', you must be sure it is the fault of the other driver. In cases where a wait call is believed to be unfounded, either disregard the request at the time, and provide proof that it was not a valid call and not a lag issue after the race to the other person or the DoubleDs - or obey the call and report it as any other incident would be it after the race. The penalty for an unfounded call or refusing to wait for a founded call are the same. A "proof" must be a video of the incident. Streaming and/or recording a race from your perspective is therefore strongly advised. Make sure that you know how to record / stream before entering a race.</p>

<h4>2) Re-enter Safely</h4>
<p>2.1) If you are knocked off the track do not make it your number one mission to get back on as quickly as possible. First wait for oncoming cars to pass and make sure you re-enter the track without getting in someone's way. If you cause an accident when coming back on the track you must again wait for the person you hit.</p>

<h4>3) Blue Flags</h4>
<p>3.1) Blue flags are present in all races. If you're about to go a lap down and the leaders are coming up behind you, safely move over to the side of the road and let them past without losing too much time. Do not under any circumstances actively block or defend from those who are trying to lap you.</p>

<p>3.2) If you, as the faster driver, cause an accident with a car you are lapping, you must still wait for them to get back physically in front of you. Even though it does not gain them back a position, it is still punishment and deterrent for you to overtake lapped cars cleanly.</p>

<h4>4) Overtaking</h4>
<p>4.1) Remember that there will be people in a race who are both better and worse than you, and that it will vary from track to track and car to car. If you are stuck behind someone who is racing cleanly but is slower than you and you can't get past then that is on you, not them. It is not an excuse to rage at them or knock them off - get better at overtaking.</p>

<p>4.2) If someone makes an overtaking move on the inside of you and they are more than half way alongside your car as you go to turn into the corner you must give them room on the inside. You cannot simply turn into them anyway. Conversely if you're not far enough up the inside of someone when attempting to overtake you should back out of the move as they are within their rights to turn into the corner and any resulting crash will be your fault.</p>

<p>4.3) If you are on the outside of someone going around a corner and you aren't at least fully alongside their car you should back out, as they are well within their rights to take the racing line and run you out of room on the outside with any resulting crash being your fault. Conversely if you're on the inside and someone is fully alongside you on the outside you must give them a car's width of space.</p>

<h4>5) Defending</h4>
<p>5.1) You can only make one move on a straight to defend your position. You can't weave from side to side to keep someone behind you.</p>
