        <h1>Hi there! </h1>
        <p><b>Welcome to gtaracing.net!</b></p>
        <p>Browse through the tracks, marvel at the hottest laps of the users who have signed up here.
          But if you want <b>more</b>, register or login! (there's a clicky-thing on top of this page)</p>

      <p>This little website aims to be a resource for all kinds of racing activities in GTA online.
        At the moment, there is a <b>Track Database</b> (right here --&gt;) with the possibility to
        enter your fastest laps.
        Registered users can also create new tracks. As soon as there are enough tracks,
        we'll have some kind of search / filter functionality as well.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is a <b>Random Grid Generator</b> available, so if you host an event with
        multiple races, you can make sure that every participant has a fair chance with their
        positions on the starting grid.</p>
      <p>And there's something exciting in development: A <b>Staggered Start Calculator</b> based
        on either Broughy1322's laps around Cutting Coroners GP or your own laps around this or similar
        tracks!</p>
