<p>Use this link to invite some players:
  <input
      class="form-control"
      type="text"
      value="{{ invite_url }}"
      onClick="this.select();">
</p>
<p>
  {{ object.comment }}
</p>
<h3>What to do next?</h3>
<p>As soon as every player is in the table, you can tell me when to start the race.</p>
<p>Then, everyone will get a visual and audible signal to start racing.</p>
