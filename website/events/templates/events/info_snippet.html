    This one's important!
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-alert" aria-hidden="true"></span></h4>
  <p>You will <b>not</b> hear the sound of the start signal if you minimize
    your browser window, so <b>keep it open</b> in the background!
    Do <b>not</b> click on the little "_" icon of the browser window's upper right corner!</p>
  <p>Also, this feature has only been tested in Chrome, Firefox and Chromium browsers.
    Use at your own risk in other browsers like Internet Explorer etc.</p>
  <h5>Mobile phone users</h5>
  <p>If you use this tool on a phone, you will probably not hear any sound, because
  phones don't usually allow sound to be played without direct interaction of a user.
  <b>But</b> you will see the screen flash green, so that should hopefully be enough notice for you.</p>
